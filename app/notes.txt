Full workflow
=============

1. Create a position.
2. Create shifts for that position.
3. Create postings for that shift.

Position editor/creator
=======================

Choose name for the position, and add/remove employees from it.

Shift editor/creator
====================

To create a shift, we go to the calendar-main view. We go to the appropriate
day when we want to create the shift, and select a box in the schedule by
dragging. This opens the shift editor.

The shift editor lets you choose the position associated with this shift, and
thus the color of the box. The hours of the shift are determined by the region
dragged in the schedule UI, but these values can be adjusted in the shift
editor.

Then, we see a listing of everyone in the workforce whose position matches the
position of the shift, and they can be added via checkboxes.

A save button is at the bottom as well as a discard button.

Creating a job posting
======================

1. Separate interface that will use the mini-calendar UI.
    The mini-calendar UI will be reduced in the sense that there will be no
    dates attached to the week.  It will augmented in the sense that clicking
    on an employee will replace them with the "Posted" ghost worker.  And there
    will be a plus glyphicon to add a new worker to the shift.  Shifts and
    positions are created a priori, before creating a posting.

2. The employer will choose the position for this position for this posting,
    and will then be able to select the shifts that they would like the
    potential employee to fill by clicking in the augmented mini-calendar UI.

    Once the employer has clicked on a day in the mini-calendar UI, there will
    be several options for selecting shifts:
     * Choose to add a new worker to that shift, by clicking a '+' glyphicon
     * Choose to replace an existing worker (because e.g. they want less hours,
         are fired, have left, etc.)

3. The employer will click save or discard to emit the job posting into the
    database.
