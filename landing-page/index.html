            Job-hunting is a full-time job. But does it need to
            be? If jobs came to you, then you wouldn't need to go looking at
            all.
            </p>

            postings on classifieds. Let Ahvoda work for you, to provide the

            Both businesses and job-hunters create profiles with their relevant
            information on Ahvoda. Behind the scenes, we use efficient matching
            algorithms to evaluate how likely each employee would enjoy each
            job in order to calculate a <em>MatchScore</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
            When a job is whose MatchScore is above a certain threshold is
            found, you receive a notification directly on your phone, or via
            email, from which you can apply to that job in one click.
            </p>
            <h3> Active search </h3>
            <p>
            Leverage the power of MatchScore to see jobs you're more likely to
            enjoy as you scroll through job postings. Again, applying to each
            job is right at your fingertips.
